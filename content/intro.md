Friends of Pooly is a community-driven initiative with a mission to defend decentralized finance and secure an Open Web3. As part of this mission, Friends of Pooly has designed Pixel Pooly, the first digital collectible, to help raise awareness and support for these important values.

The Open Web3 is a vision for a decentralized internet, where every individual has equitable access to digital computations, currencies, and networks. Accessibility is key to this vision, and Friends of Pooly believes that accessibility should be prioritized above all else. This means ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background or resources, has the ability to participate in the Ethereum network state.

In addition to accessibility, neutrality is also critical to the success of the Open Web3. The internet must remain a neutral space, where technological, protocol, and computational neutrality is maintained. This creates trust and openness, which are essential for fostering a truly decentralized ecosystem.

Digital ownership is another important value that Friends of Pooly seeks to uphold. Every individual has the right to own their digital assets, including cryptographic instruments like mnemonic phrases and passwords. No one should be able to gain unauthorized access to these assets without the owner's expressed permission or pursuant to applicable laws.

Finally, privacy is also crucial to the success of the Open Web3. Every individual has the right to participate in public and private cryptographic ceremonies, including encryption and secret sharing. This ensures that people can communicate and assemble freely without fear of surveillance or censorship.

In conclusion, Friends of Pooly is on a mission to defend decentralized finance and secure an Open Web3. Through initiatives like Pixel Pooly and their commitment to values like accessibility, neutrality, digital ownership, and privacy, they are helping to create a more equitable and decentralized future for everyone.
