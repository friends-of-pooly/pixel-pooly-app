            Lobby3 is a Web3 community that aims to give individuals and groups a more influential voice in Washington, D.C. by leveraging blockchain
            technology to advocate for a more decentralized and secure financial ecosystem. The Friends of Pooly is a group of enthusiasts and
            supporters of Pixel Pooly, a gaming platform built on the blockchain that allows users to trade unique digital assets called non-fungible
            tokens (NFTs).
          </p>
          <p className="">
            By teaming up, Lobby3 and Friends of Pooly are launching a new digital collectible that will be sold as an NFT, with the proceeds being
            used to fund DeFi lobbyists in Washington D.C. These lobbyists will work towards protecting and advancing the decentralized finance
            ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            In Season 1 of Pixel Pooly, 80% of the proceeds from the sale of the new digital collectible will be donated to Lobby3. This contribution
            will help Lobby3 in their mission to empower individuals and communities to take an active role in shaping financial policy and
            regulations. With the support of Friends of Pooly, Lobby3 aims to build a more prosperous economic future for everyone by advocating for a
            more inclusive and decentralized financial system.

            Defending decentralized finance (DeFi) and securing an open Web3 are critical for the future of our global economy and financial systems.
            Decentralization is the fundamental principle of blockchain technology that enables DeFi, which is a revolutionary concept that allows
            anyone with an internet connection to participate in a borderless, transparent, and decentralized financial system.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            DeFi offers numerous advantages over traditional finance, including greater accessibility, lower transaction fees, faster settlement
            times, and increased transparency. DeFi platforms provide users with direct control over their assets without the need for intermediaries
            such as banks or brokers. This eliminates the risk of counterparty default and enhances security, which is critical given the prevalence
            of hacking and data breaches in centralized financial systems.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            An open Web3 is an ecosystem built on decentralized and distributed technologies, where users have the freedom to interact and transact
            without restrictions or censorship. An open Web3 promotes innovation, collaboration, and participation, as it allows anyone to develop and
            launch decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            However, these innovations face significant challenges from regulators, traditional financial institutions, and other centralized
            entities. These stakeholders may perceive DeFi and Web3 as a threat to their interests, leading them to push back against its development
            and adoption. This can include regulatory hurdles, censorship, and even outright bans on the use of DeFi and Web3 technologies.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Advocacy groups such as Lobby3 play a crucial role in promoting awareness, education, and regulatory engagement to ensure that these
            emerging technologies can continue to grow and evolve in a responsible and sustainable manner. By advocating for the benefits of DeFi and
            the open Web3, we can ensure that these technologies are accessible to everyone and help create a more equitable and transparent financial
            future.
